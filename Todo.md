# Todo: Linear Regression Design Steps

- [x] **1. Business Understanding:** Define the problem: Predict house prices based on size.
- [x] **2. Data Understanding:** Source or generate data. For this case, we generated synthetic data.
- [x] **3. Data Preparation:**
    - [x] Load data into a pandas DataFrame.
    - [x] Define features (X) and target (y).
    - [x] Split data into training and testing sets.
- [x] **4. Modeling:**
    - [x] Choose a model: `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
    - [x] Train the model on the training data.
- [x] **5. Evaluation:**
    - [x] Make predictions on the test data.
    - [x] Evaluate the model using metrics (MSE, RÂ²).
    - [x] Visualize the results.
- [x] **6. Deployment:**
    - [x] Create a function to use the trained model for new predictions.
